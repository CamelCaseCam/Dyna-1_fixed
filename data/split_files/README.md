`relaxdb_WITH_PHOS.txt` contains 133 proteins curated from our pipeline.

`relaxdb.txt` contains 112 proteins, removing those characterized in phosphate buffer and where exchange occurs that is unlikely to be attributable to us-ms exchange.

NB: In AUROC/AUPRC calculations, we did not consider proteins with no missing assignment/exchange labels. This corresponds to entries '5839', '6470', 'ORC2WH','PLEXINB1'.

`relaxdb-CPMG.txt` contains 10 proteins with to CPMG datasets.
